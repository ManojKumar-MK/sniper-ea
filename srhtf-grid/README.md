# srhtf-grid — SR_HTF_StopEntry_EA

36 sets, M5.

```
.\RUN_SRHTF.bat        ONE CLICK: compile -> prove on one set -> run 36 sets over 2026
.\RUN_SRHTF_4Y.bat     the same 36 sets over 2023-2026 (144 runs), once one looks good
```

`RUN_SRHTF.bat` compiles the EA, runs **`SR_ctrl` alone** and stops if that produces no
report, then runs the other 35. The grid EA burned a whole 100-pass run producing
nothing, so nothing here commits to 36 passes before one has worked.

**If step 2 prints `(0 files)` and `ZERO RUNS`,** you are on a build from before the
single-`.set` fix. `RUNSETS.bat` read the extension off `%~x1`, which is empty by then
because the argument loop has already shifted every argument away — so a `.set` file
fell through to the folder branch and globbed `SR_ctrl.set\*.set`, which matches
nothing. It now reads the extension off the variable instead. Pull and rerun.

## `InpResetState=true` in every set, and why that is not optional

`GVName()` builds its keys from `InpMagic`:

```cpp
string GVName(string s) { return "SRHTF_" + IntegerToString(InpMagic) + "_" + s; }
```

`InpMagic` is identical in all 36 sets, so they share one global-variable namespace. A
set that trips `acc_halt` leaves `SRHTF_52741_acc_halt` behind, and the **next** set
reads it at `OnInit`:

```cpp
g_accHalted = GlobalVariableCheck(GVName("acc_halt"));
```

and starts already halted — taking no trades at all, for the whole run.

Two things set `acc_halt`, and the second is the nasty one:

| | |
|---|---|
| the max-loss guard | a **bad** set poisons the ones after it |
| `InpTargetLock` reaching `InpTargetPct` | a **good** set poisons the ones after it |

So without the reset, the better a set performs the more damage it does to the rest of
the grid — and the result would look like a strategy that stops working halfway through
the alphabet. `InpResetState=true` calls `GlobalVariablesDeleteAll(GVName(""))` at
`OnInit`, which clears it.

`InpNewsFilter` is set `false` too. The EA already ignores it under `MQL_TESTER`, so this
only makes the sets say what they mean.

## The chart timeframe does not matter

`_Period` appears **nowhere** in the source — every read uses an explicit input
(`InpEntryTF`, `InpTF1..3`, `InpRangeTF`). M5 is used to match `InpEntryTF`, so the
drawings and the analysis line up, but the behaviour is the same on any chart.

## The blocks

| block | sets |
|---|---|
| control | `SR_ctrl` — the author's own defaults |
| HTF agreement | `agree1` `agree2` — how much of the A+ gate is earning its place |
| reward:risk | `rr2` `rr4` `rr5` `fixedrr` |
| location / structure | `nopd` `swing1` `swing3` `range15` `range60` |
| the sweep | `sweep6` `sweep20` `pool10` `pool40` |
| the stop order | `buf5` `buf50` `expiry3` `expiry12` `sl15` `sl60` |
| entry timeframe | `entry_m1` `entry_m15` |
| HTF set | `htf_m15h1h4` |
| sessions | `london_only` `ny_only` `wide_sess` |
| management | `nobe` `be2` `trades4` `sl_wide` |
| risk | `risk025` `risk1` |
| funded | `fn_nolock` `fn_tight` |

`SR_fn_nolock` and `SR_fn_tight` turn `InpTargetLock` **off** on purpose. With it on, a
run stops the moment it reaches +8% — which is correct for a challenge and useless for
measuring a year, because every good year truncates at the same number.

## Reading it

1. **`SR_ctrl` first.** If the author's defaults have no edge across four years, nothing
   downstream supplies one.
2. **`agree1` / `agree2` against `ctrl`.** `InpMinAgree=3` is the A+ premise. If 1 or 2
   does as well, the premise is not doing the work.
3. **Equity drawdown against `InpMaxGuardPct`**, not balance drawdown.
4. **Then 2024.** Every grid EA reviewed lost there, and so did both of our own
   strategies — it is the year that has separated real from fitted so far.
5. **Rank by the worst year**, never the best.
